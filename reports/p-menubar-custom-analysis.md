# PrimeNG `p-menubar-custom` Class Analysis

## Summary of Changes

The `p-menubar-custom` class has been completely removed from the PrimeNG library between versions 17 and 19. This change occurred in two separate commits:

1. First in September 2023 (commit 833d4ff08) as part of a refactoring effort (#13737)
2. Then confirmed in July 2024 (commit c953a33c1) during a theming update for Menubar

This indicates a deliberate removal of the class as part of the library's evolution, starting with a refactoring and finalized with theming changes.

## High Confidence Replacements

There are no explicit replacements mentioned in the change logs for the `p-menubar-custom` class. The class was simply removed without a direct replacement being specified.

## Ambiguous Bidirectional Changes

No ambiguous bidirectional changes were detected in this log.

## Structural Changes

- The `.p-menubar .p-menubar-custom` selector was originally added in July 2020 (commit c5f3d87e3) during a migration to "primeone"
- The selector was completely removed as of September 2023, suggesting either:
  1. The functionality it provided is no longer needed
  2. The functionality was moved to a different class/approach
  3. The styling pattern changed in a way that made this class obsolete

The removal suggests a structural change in how custom content within the menubar component is handled in newer versions of PrimeNG.

Since no replacement is explicitly mentioned, developers who were using this class would need to investigate the current documentation for the preferred way to handle custom menubar content in the newer versions.
